# Audio Setup for Task Completion

## 📁 Required Audio File

To enable the task completion sound, you need to add an MP3 audio file:

**File location:** `public/sounds/task-completed.mp3`

## 🎵 Audio File Requirements

- **Format:** MP3
- **Duration:** 0.5-1.5 seconds (recommended)
- **Type:** Pleasant completion sound (chime, ding, success sound)
- **Volume:** Moderate level (the app will set volume to 30%)
- **Size:** Keep file size small for fast loading

## 🔧 Fallback Behavior

If the MP3 file is not found, the app will automatically use a Web Audio API-generated beep sound as fallback. This ensures the feedback system always works, even without the custom audio file.

## 🚀 Testing

1. Add your `task-completed.mp3` file to the `public/sounds/` folder
2. Restart the development server
3. Complete a task to test the sound
4. Check browser console for any audio-related errors

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- **Desktop:** Works in all modern browsers
- **Mobile:** May require user interaction first (autoplay restrictions)
- **Fallback:** Web Audio API beep if MP3 fails to load

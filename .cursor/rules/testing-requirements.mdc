# Testing Requirements

After implementing any new functionality or making changes to the Todo AI app, always run Cypress e2e tests to verify the changes work correctly.

## Commands
- `npm run cy:parallel` - **DEFAULT: Always use this** - Runs tests in 7 parallel threads for faster execution
- `npm run cy:run` - Headless testing (single thread, slower but more reliable)
- `npm run cy:run:headed` - Headed testing (see browser)
- `npm run cy:open` - Interactive testing mode

## Note on Parallel Execution
Parallel tests may show login race condition failures in `beforeEach` hooks when multiple tests try to authenticate with the same Firebase test account simultaneously. These failures are infrastructure-related, not code bugs. If you see failures only in `beforeEach` login hooks, the actual feature code is likely fine.

## When to Test
- After implementing new features
- After bug fixes
- After refactoring existing code
- Before considering a task complete

## Test Location
- Test files are in `cypress/e2e/`
- Custom commands in `cypress/support/commands.ts`
